# Horse Survival Prediction
Welcome to the Horse Survival Prediction project! This repository hosts a collection of tools and models designed to predict the survival outcomes of horses facing various health conditions. Leveraging machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset, my goal is to provide veterinarians with accurate predictive insights to aid in their decision-making process and improve equine welfare. Whether you're a data scientist, veterinarian, or enthusiast interested in the intersection of technology and veterinary medicine, I invite you to explore my code, contribute to my research efforts, and join me in advancing the field of predictive analytics in equine care.
